# maze_generator
JavaFX random maze generator

This is a portfolio project for a random maze generator.  Walls are arranged to random locations which creates a maze.  A fully-connected graph is formed on every traversable location in between the walls.  Breadth-first search is used to determine the shortest solution path which may be used in the future for a scoring system.
